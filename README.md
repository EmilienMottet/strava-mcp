# Strava MCP Server

This project implements a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server in TypeScript that acts as a bridge to the Strava API. It exposes Strava data and functionalities as "tools" that Large Language Models (LLMs) can utilize through the MCP standard.

## Natural Language Interaction Examples

Ask your AI assistant questions like these to interact with your Strava data:

-   "Show me my recent Strava activities."
-   "Get my Strava profile information."
-   "What are my running stats for this year on Strava?"
-   "Give me the details for my last run (activity ID 12345)."
-   "What Strava clubs am I in?"
-   "List the segments I starred near Boulder, Colorado."
-   "Star the 'Flagstaff Road Climb' segment (ID 654321) for me."
-   "Show my efforts on the 'Sunshine Canyon' segment (ID 987654) this month."
-   "List my saved Strava routes."
-   "What is the elevation gain for route 112233?"
-   "Export my 'Boulder Loop' route (ID 7654321) as a GPX file."

## Features

-   üèÉ Access recent activities, profile, and stats.
-   üó∫Ô∏è Explore, view, star, and manage segments.
-   ‚è±Ô∏è View detailed activity and segment effort information.
-   üìç List and view details of saved routes.
-   üíæ Export routes in GPX or TCX format to the local filesystem.
-   ü§ñ AI-friendly JSON responses via MCP.
-   üîß Uses Strava API V3.

## Installation & Setup

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    -   Node.js (v18 or later recommended)
    -   npm (usually comes with Node.js)
    -   A Strava Account

2.  **Clone Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url> strava-mcp
    cd strava-mcp
    ```
    *(Replace `<repository_url>` with the actual URL)*

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    -   Copy the example `.env.example` file to `.env`:
        ```bash
        cp .env.example .env
        ```
    -   Edit the `.env` file:
        ```dotenv
        # Strava API Access Token
        # Get yours from https://www.strava.com/settings/api
        STRAVA_ACCESS_TOKEN=YOUR_COPIED_ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE

        # Optional: Define a path for saving exported route files (GPX/TCX)
        # Ensure this directory exists and the server process has write permissions.
        # Example: ROUTE_EXPORT_PATH=/Users/your_username/strava-exports
        ROUTE_EXPORT_PATH=
        ```
    -   **Obtain Strava Access Token:**
        1.  Go to your Strava API Settings page: [https://www.strava.com/settings/api](https://www.strava.com/settings/api)
        2.  Create an API application if you haven't already.
        3.  Copy the "Your Access Token" value.
        4.  Paste this token into the `.env` file as the value for `STRAVA_ACCESS_TOKEN`.
    -   **Set Export Path (Optional):** If you want to use the `export-route-gpx` or `export-route-tcx` tools, set `ROUTE_EXPORT_PATH` to an **absolute path** to a directory where the server process has write permissions. Exported files will be saved here.

5.  **Build the Project:**
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

6.  **Run the Server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    The server will connect via Stdio.

## Usage Examples

An LLM assistant (like Claude) can use the tools provided by this server based on natural language prompts. The assistant will typically identify the correct tool and extract the necessary parameters from the user's request.

-   **User:** "Show my last 5 activities."
    -   **LLM Action:** Calls `get-recent-activities` with `perPage: 5`.
-   **User:** "What was my average heart rate on activity 987654321?"
    -   **LLM Action:** Calls `get-activity-details` with `activityId: 987654321`. (The LLM would then parse the response to answer the specific question).
-   **User:** "Find cycling segments near 40.01,-105.27,40.03,-105.25 that are Cat 4 or harder."
    -   **LLM Action:** Calls `explore-segments` with `bounds: "40.01,-105.27,40.03,-105.25"`, `activityType: "riding"`, `maxCat: 4`.
-   **User:** "Save route 12345 as a GPX file."
    -   **LLM Action:** Calls `export-route-gpx` with `routeId: 12345`. (Requires `ROUTE_EXPORT_PATH` to be configured).
